# Pokedex

A Pokedex project created with Node.js, express, ejs and postgresql. 

The goal was to create a web app who use node.js and express to create a server.

Views was render into ejs.

It use express-session for managing the storage of the pokemons into bookmarks page.


There is a lot things to refactor and change, but I want to recreate it into React.



## Installation

Install Pokedex with npm

```bash
  npm install
```

You need to change your .env with .env_example informations. (The BDD is private, host on heroku).

You can install the database locally, the .sql is here for that.
